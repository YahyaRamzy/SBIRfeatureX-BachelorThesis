# Feature Extraction for Sketch Based Image Retrieval

## Project Description

This repository contains the code and resources for my bachelor's thesis project, titled "Feature Extraction for Sketch Based Image Retrieval." The project focuses on comparing the performance of traditional machine learning and transfer learning approaches in developing a system that can extract features from hand-drawn sketches and search for related images from a dataset based on the extracted features.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of traditional machine learning algorithms and transfer learning techniques in feature extraction from sketches. The goal is to provide designers and artists with a tool that can assist in the creative process by identifying related images based on their hand-drawn sketches.

## Key Features

- Comparative analysis of traditional machine learning and transfer learning methods
- Feature extraction from hand-drawn sketches
- Image retrieval based on extracted features
